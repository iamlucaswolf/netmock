# netmock: Simulate Go network connections

netmock is a Go package for simulating [net](https://pkg.go.dev/net)
connections, including delays and disconnects.

**This is work in progress. The README will be updated with future commits.**

## Acknowledgements

Parts of netmock have been adapted from the
[bufconn](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/test/bufconn) package from
[grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go).
